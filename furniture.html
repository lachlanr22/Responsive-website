          <p>Gordon Andrews (1914–2001) was a multi-disciplinary Australian designer of both local and international significance. The Gazelle chair represents an important aspect of his work – furniture design.</p>
          <p>This graceful three-legged ‘Gazelle’ chair, made of plywood, cast aluminium, steel and wool, is a slightly modified version of a chair Andrews designed during his time as design consultant to the Italian firm Olivetti. It featured in the company's showroom in London (1954) and in Sydney (1956). By 1957, the original four wooden legs were replaced by three in cast aluminium. Few examples survive.</p>

          <p>‘Perch’ stool by Gordon Andrews</p>
          <p>‘Saddle’-like seat supported on a circular pole. Stool is stabilised at the base by four arms radiating at right angles from the pole across the floor in a cross shape. Seat is roughly oval form with the sides curved to give the saddle-like effect. Seat has been covered with lightly padded olive green vinyl. Stem and foot painted matt black.</p>
          <p>The object was originally borrowed as a bare frame but reupholstered by the museum, to Gordon Andrews' instructions, in olive green coloured vinyl supplied by him. The stem and legs were also painted matt black, according to his instructions.</p>

          <p>The Rondo chair was originally designed by Gordon Andrews in 1956 and first featured in the Sydney showroom he designed for Olivetti. In the early 1960s he changed the splayed-base to a star-base. According to Gordon Andrews, he had the Rondo chair components made up by different firms and then he assembled the pieces himself. The original shell was developed from two flat marine plywood shapes brought together and cemented to a timber spine. This fibreglass shell is the second version.</p>
