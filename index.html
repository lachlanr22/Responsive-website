      <h3>Australian Decimal Banknotes (1966) – Image of the $2 Note</h3>
      <p>
        Gordon Andrews designed Australia’s first decimal banknotes, introduced in 1966, creating a distinctly
        Australian visual identity. The $2 note featured William Charles Wentworth, one of the early explorers of the
        Blue Mountains and a key political figure. This note was part of a broader suite of currency that marked the
        country’s shift to decimalisation and reflected its national heritage. Andrews’ work on the banknotes also
        incorporated state-of-the-art anti-counterfeiting measures, shaping the future of Australian currency design.

      <h3>Cameron Offices (1970s) – Architectural Interiors & Wayfinding</h3>
      <p>
        Designed in collaboration with architect John Andrews (no relation), the Cameron Offices in Canberra were an
        example of Brutalist architecture where Gordon Andrews contributed to interior design and navigation systems.
        His work blended functionality with modernist aesthetics, integrating custom signage and design elements that
        helped define user experience within the government offices. His contributions were pioneering in how
        environmental graphics and signage could enhance interaction and user experience in large-scale public spaces.

          <h2>About Gordon Andrews</h2>
          <p>
            Gordon Andrews (1914–2001) was an influential Australian designer whose work spanned multiple disciplines,
            including industrial design, graphic design, and exhibition design. Born in Sydney, Andrews initially trained
            as an artist before transitioning into design, where he became a pivotal figure in shaping modern Australian
            visual culture. His career began in the 1930s, and by the post-war period, he had established himself as a
            leading designer, working on projects both domestically and internationally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andrews was deeply interested in modernist principles, and his work often reflected a fusion of functionality
            and aesthetic innovation. He was particularly influenced by European and Scandinavian design movements,
            which he encountered during his travels. These experiences broadened his perspective and contributed to his
            reputation as a forward-thinking designer in Australia.
