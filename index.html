          <h3>Australian Decimal Banknotes (1966) – Image of the $2 Note</h3>
          <p>Gordon Andrews designed Australia’s first decimal banknotes, introduced in 1966, creating a distinctly Australian visual identity. The $2 note features John Macarthur, a key figure in the wool industry, with intricate security patterns and vibrant colours. Andrews’ work combined artistic detail with anti-counterfeiting measures, shaping the future of Australian currency design.</p>

          <h3>Cameron Offices (1970s) – Architectural Interiors & Wayfinding</h3>
          <p>Designed in collaboration with architect John Andrews (no relation), the Cameron Offices in Canberra were an example of Brutalist architecture, where Gordon Andrews contributed to interior design and wayfinding systems. His work blended functionality with modernist aesthetics, integrating custom signage and design elements that complemented the building’s geometric, industrial structure. His approach to urban design helped enhance navigation and user experience in large-scale public spaces.</p>
